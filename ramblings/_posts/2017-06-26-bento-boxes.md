Welp, looks like I'm making my first ever [ramble](http://seanmythen.net/ramblings/) about Bento Boxes.
The other day I finally got around to getting my site back online and coincidentally I had just found a new lunch box at the market.
Previously I'd been biking to work with a plastic Walmart bag that I'd deemed 'my lunchbox'.

I'd been trying to eat healthier and save money the past couple months, but I wasn't able to make it stick.  My Bento Box Lunch Box turned out to be my savior!  Something about packing a meal at home and bringing it with you to open during lunch is so rewarding; I feel like link opening a treasure chest.  Acquiring a 'proper' lunch box has also pushed me to explore diverse types of food that I really enjoy eating.  This may sound silly, but I think my new lunch box is making me a better person! Ok, it does sound silly.

Check back in on my [Ramblings](http://seanmythen.net/ramblings/) from time to time to see what I'm up to.
